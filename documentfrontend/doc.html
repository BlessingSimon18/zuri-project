                    <h3>What is Animate99?</h3>
                    <p>
                        Animate99 is a JavaScript animation library built for beginner developers. It allows you to easily
                        incorporate animations into your programs without the hassle of writing the code from scratch.<br>
                        Built into the library is a collection of functions written using normal language (for ease of use)
                        and defined to produce specific animation effects. The developer is also provided with
                        substantial flexibility in how they choose to apply the animations to their code.

                    <h3>JavaScript vs CSS animations, what’s the difference?</h3>
                    <p>
    Scripted animations provide greater control and flexibility compared to CSS animations.
    Animating with CSS may seem like the easiest way to get something moving on your screen but
    you will need JavaScript when you need significant control over your animations, because
    JavaScript doesn’t just provide you with animation functionality, it allows you to easily
    customize exactly just how you want these animations to behave in your program. The selling
    point of the Animate99 library is that it does the heavy lifting of creating customizable and
    flexible animation functions, all you have to do is sit back and call on them.

                    <h3>How does it work?</h3>
                    <p>
                        Animate99 is built upon the Web Animations API. This API is a native implementation of
    scripted animations which allows developers to manipulate the animation engine of a browser
    using nothing else but plain JavaScript, this means developers can have little to no need to
    utilize multiple libraries in order to create cool animations.
    This also reduces the number of third-party dependencies a program will ultimately have.
    Another benefit of using JavaScript as the main animation engine is that it aids in maintaining a
    distinction between behavioral and presentational attributes and this is very important in
    modern web development

                    <h3>Getting started!</h3>
                    <p>
                        In order to get started using the Animate99 animation library, you will first need to register as a
    user on our website at www.animate99.com . Once you are a registered user, you will have
    access to the library and the option of either embedding/importing the animation library script file.

                    <h3>Importing Animate99</h3>
                    <p>
                        In order to use Animate99, you will need to import the library by adding the library’s script.js file
                        as a script tag to the head tag of your HTML document. To ensure that your other JavaScript
                        files have access to all the animation functions within the library, you need to also make sure
                        that along with the library’s script.js file, all other JavaScript files being used in your program are
                        added as script tags within the head tag of the HTML document.
